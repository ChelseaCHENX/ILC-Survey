I was not given standard treatment of care. Also, I was told repeatedly that the cancer would not be found in my lymph nodes. At the time of surgery, the doctor did not see the cancer in my lymph nodes. One week later I received a phone call around 9:30 at night telling me that cancer was found. I was then informed that they probably would not give me radiation. The surgeon says that she normally goes back in for more lymph nodes, but she thought that she had gotten enough. I had no idea about going back for more lymph nodes, it was not discussed at a proper time, or ever again with the surgeon, and I was suffering with a terrible infection and seroma when I was told. I had mentioned the pain I suffered and inquired several times if this was normal, to be told it was. It was not. I had an infection from day one.
