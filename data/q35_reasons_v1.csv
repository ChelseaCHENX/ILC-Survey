R_2vjBYqDcrz8f16B,No12,"Currently in my translational science role we do not include ILC cell models but we are looking to do so through external collaboration. We tend to look for signals of drug response in the ""standard"" breast cancer cell line models of HR+ disease, which are easy to work with and are well known entities. So there is a gap in understanding of how to work with ILC models. Preclinical teams work to inform clinical strategy, which at the moment does not distinguish ILC and IDC. Ultimately, clinical teams would consider ILC separately if there is a business case to do so. This is the key barrier to address and the case would need to be demonstrated through collaboration with external partners. Collaborations will include external sponsored preclinical workstreams and initial clinical studies focussed on ILC. If these demonstrate a clear signal, then the case is built for future studies to be powered and / or stratified for ILC.",Professional role does not involve cell model studies or basic research
