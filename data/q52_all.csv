At the time of surgery, the doctor did not see the cancer in my lymph nodes. One week later I received a phone call around 9:30 at night telling me that cancer was found. I was then informed that they probably would not give me radiation. The surgeon says that she normally goes back in for more lymph nodes, but she thought that she had gotten enough. I had no idea about going back for more lymph nodes, it was not discussed at a proper time, or ever again with the surgeon, and I was suffering with a terrible infection and seroma when I was told.

I recognized a physical change many years earlier and mentioned pain but did not pursue treatment because was told that it was not breast cancer. I did not follow up on further symptoms until 5 or 6 years later when I noticed more obvious physical changes and was due for a mamogram at age 50. I believe that women should be made aware of ILC and that you may be more at risk if you have dense breasts. No one ever talked to me about that, and becuase I didn't have any knowledge of breast cancer I followed the recommended screening which was not to have a mammogram until age 50."
